## MARRSS
In the past few decades an increasing number of pico- and nano- satellites were launched into orbit by universities and research institutes. For these satellites ground station networks were created to monitor and communicate with the satellites. Integrating these ground station into a large network offers great potential to increase contact times and further monitor and gather more data from the satellites in orbit. However such a network needs to be coordinated and scheduling the satellites to certain ground stations becomes an important issue. This problem of assigning multiple satellites to multiple ground stations is called Multi Resource Range Scheduling Problem (MuSRRSP). 

This Software was created to implement different scheduling approaches for an academical ground station network and to evaluate their performance for different scenarios.
